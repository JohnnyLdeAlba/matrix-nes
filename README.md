# What was the Purpose of this Project?

I was looking for a platform to port my ill fated [Agartha](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-flash) game engine to. I abandoned this project because assembly is too time consuming and I felt it would be better if I stuck to a high level language instead.
